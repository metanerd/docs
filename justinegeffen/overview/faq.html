<div class="section" id="why-was-mattermost-created">
<h3>Why was Mattermost created?<a class="headerlink" href="#why-was-mattermost-created" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Mattermost was created to offer an alternative to proprietary SaaS services. For more information, please see the article <a class="reference external" href="https://mattermost.org/why-we-made-mattermost-an-open-source-slack-alternative/">Why we made Mattermost</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="why-does-the-open-source-repository-contain-code-specific-to-the-commercial-version-of-mattermost">
<h3>Why does the open source repository contain code specific to the commercial version of Mattermost?<a class="headerlink" href="#why-does-the-open-source-repository-contain-code-specific-to-the-commercial-version-of-mattermost" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The commercial version of Mattermost is designed to never lock-in your data. Portions of the commercial version are shared with the open source version to ensure upgrade and downgrade across editions happens without data loss.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="does-mattermost-support-508-compliance">
<h3>Does Mattermost support 508 Compliance?<a class="headerlink" href="#does-mattermost-support-508-compliance" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Yes, please see our <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.mattermost.com/overview/vpat.html">VPAT</a> form for details. Mattermost Enterprise Edition has been purchased by multiple US public sector organizations, including US federal agencies and the Department of Defense.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="what-s-the-largest-mattermost-deployment-you-have">
<h3>What’s the largest Mattermost deployment you have?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-s-the-largest-mattermost-deployment-you-have" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Our largest contractual obligation is for over a quarter of a million registered users. Our most typical large enterprise deployment size is between 10,000 and 40,000 users in Dev and Ops organizations who use Mattermost for DevOps workflows, remote work, mission-critical and rapid response, and to address email overload.</p>
<p>We have done performance testing of 60,000 concurrent users and 60 million posts in the database, with a peak concurrent utilization safety factor of between 10 to 1 and 3 to 1, depending on the distribution of an organization across time zones. Peak concurrent usage in a single timezone is generally around start of day, probably 9am, and lunch time when people are messaging to meet for a meal.  Our monthly releases are tested at 20 million posts in the database.</p>
<p>Mattermost provides an open source, well-documented <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-load-test">load test simulator</a> to verify that your Mattermost deployment can achieve the stated scale benchmarks ahead of production deployment.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="how-do-i-deploy-the-open-source-mattermost-team-edition-under-an-mit-license">
<h3>How do I deploy the open source Mattermost Team Edition under an MIT license?<a class="headerlink" href="#how-do-i-deploy-the-open-source-mattermost-team-edition-under-an-mit-license" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The open source Mattermost Team Edition is functionally identical to the commercial Mattermost Enterprise Edition in its free “team mode”, but there is no ability to unlock enterprise features. It deploys as single Linux binary with MySQL or PostgreSQL under an MIT license.</p>
<p>We generally recommend installing Enterprise Edition, even if you don’t currently need a license. This provides the flexibility to seamlessly unlock Enterprise features should you need them. However, if you only want to install software with a fully open source code base, then Team Edition is the best choice for you.</p>
<p>To deploy the Team Edition, download the <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.mattermost.com/administration/version-archive.html#mattermost-team-edition-server-archive">Mattermost Team Edition binary</a>, and follow our standard install guides. The same applies to server upgrades.</p>

<p>Yes, push notifications are free if you compile your own <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-push-proxy">push-proxy service</a>. Push notifications are also free if you use the hosted Test Push Notification Service (TPNS) provided by Mattermost, Inc.</p>
<p>TPNS, hosted at <a class="reference external" href="https://push-test.mattermost.com">https://push-test.mattermost.com</a>, offers transport-level encryption, but not production-level service level agreements (SLAs).</p>
<p>If you need production-level SLAs for push notifications, you can either compile your own push-proxy service, with your own key, or you can use a paid option and become a Mattermost Enterprise Edition E10 subscriber <a class="reference external" href="https://about.mattermost.com/default-terms/">agreeing to our Conditions of Use</a>, which enables you to use a production-level Hosted Push Notification Service (HPNS) at <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">https://push.mattermost.com</span></code>.</p>

<p>Mattermost Enterprise Edition is a commercial workplace messaging solution for large organizations operating under compliance and security requirements that is built on top of the open source Mattermost Team Edition.</p>

<h3>How does Mattermost scale from teams to enterprises?<a class="headerlink" href="#how-does-mattermost-scale-from-teams-to-enterprises" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Growing your Mattermost installation from supporting a team to supporting an enterprise requires two types of scaling:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Technical scaling: Maintaining system responsiveness as large quantities of new users are added.</li>
<li>Functional scaling: Adding advanced features to support the increased complexity of large organizations.</li>
</ol>
</div></blockquote>
<p><strong>Technical Scaling:</strong> Whether used for teams or enterprises, the Mattermost server is designed to support tens of thousands of users on a single server with appropriate hardware. The server is built using Golang, the language developed by Google to create internet-scale applications, and supports highly scalable databases like MySQL, which is <a class="reference external" href="https://www.facebook.com/notes/facebook-engineering/mysql-and-database-engineering-mark-callaghan/10150599729938920/">used extensively by Facebook</a>. Beyond tens of thousands of users, Mattermost Enterprise Edition can offer high availability/horizontal scaling configurations using multiple servers to support even larger organizations.</p>
<p><strong>Functional Scaling:</strong> Scaling from a team to an enterprise is like going from a “virtual office” to a “virtual campus”. Advanced features like enterprise authentication, granular permissions, compliance and auditing, and advanced reporting become increasingly important as organizations grow beyond teams. Organizations needing this flexibility can easily upgrade from Mattermost Team Edition to Mattermost Enterprise Edition, as well as downgrade without data loss, should their needs change.</p>
<p>For more information on how Mattermost scales, technically, and functionally, please <a class="reference external" href="https://mattermost.com/contact-us/">contact the Enterprise team</a> and <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.mattermost.com/deployment/scaling.html">read about scaling for Enterprise</a>.</p>

<h3>What does it take to manage a Mattermost deployment?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-does-it-take-to-manage-a-mattermost-deployment" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>For a small deployment of Mattermost up to a few hundred users, we’d recommend a part-time, mid-level IT admin, with a senior IT admin for supervision and as a backup resource. They should have the ability to administer a basic Linux server, a MySQL or PostgreSQL database, and web proxy configuration with web sockets.</p>
<p>For a medium deployment of 500 to 2000 users, we’d recommend a senior IT administrator who has the capability to configure Mattermost in a High Availability cluster with redundant database and application servers. They should also be able to activate performance monitoring and health check features in Prometheus and Grafana.</p>

<div class="section" id="how-do-you-manage-multiple-messaging-solutions-in-an-enterprise">
<h3>How do you manage multiple messaging solutions in an enterprise?<a class="headerlink" href="#how-do-you-manage-multiple-messaging-solutions-in-an-enterprise" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Our customers address multiple collaboration solutions in different ways depending on whether the organization is more top down or bottom up.</p>
<p><strong>For top-down, customers want to simplify and leverage investments in a central, flexible, innovative solution that can scale.</strong> There’s generally a lot of pain with different teams and departments running their own messaging tools, creating silos, redundancy, and significant productivity loss. They’ll roll out Mattermost as an official solution and centralize communication there. For an example of this, see our <a class="reference external" href="https://mattermost.com/customers/">Uber case study</a>.</p>
<p><strong>For bottom-up, customers want to supplement for strategic advantage.</strong> We’ve seen teams flock to Mattermost because of its productivity benefits for DevOps, remote work, rapid response, and scaling large teams where people are overloaded with email. Those organizations, which can have hundreds to thousands of users, will use Mattermost in parallel with general purpose messaging that doesn’t meet their specific needs.</p>
<p>One example is Wargaming, one of the world’s largest operators of real-time online video games, with over a 150 million players on their system. They’ve moved their DevOps, design, analytics. and support teams to Mattermost as a supplement to Skype for Business. This is their company-wide, general purpose messenger, that isn’t optimized for large DevOps organizations and the degree of integration and flexibility that they need - specifically for DevOps. People want support for Linux and Mac desktops, lots of APIs and hooks to integrate, plugins to embed certain types of reports and interactive controls into messages, friendly keyboard shortcuts, and dozens of other enhancements that provide a distinct advantage to their counterparts at other companies.</p>

<p>When the Mattermost Source Available <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">LICENSE</span></code> file appears at the root of a repository, the restrictions apply to all source code within the repository. A note in the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">README.md</span></code> often identifies the use of this license and links to this FAQ.</p>
<p>When the Mattermost Source Available <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">LICENSE</span></code> file appears in a specific directory, the restrictions apply to all source code within that directory. This directory is often called “enterprise”. For additional clarity, an additional <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">LICENSE.enterprise</span></code> file may appear in the root directory, symlinked to the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">enterprise/LICENSE</span></code> file.</p>
<p>In all cases, any third party components remain licensed under their original license.</p>
<p>An example directory layout is shown below:</p>

<div class="section" id="why-are-you-changing-the-licensing-model">
<h3>Why are you changing the licensing model?<a class="headerlink" href="#why-are-you-changing-the-licensing-model" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Our plugin framework delivers substantial value to our enterprise customers, but requires significant development and support resources. This change to the licensing model allows us to continue developing open source features while selectively charging for features.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="how-are-repositories-changing">
<h3>How are repositories changing?<a class="headerlink" href="#how-are-repositories-changing" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>As we add enterprise-only functionality, we will update the license on affected Mattermost authored plugin repositories. The intent is to work alongside the existing, open source functionality in our plugins while reserving certain enterprise functionality to customers who pay us for enterprise licenses.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="to-which-repositories-does-this-apply">
<h3>To which repositories does this apply?<a class="headerlink" href="#to-which-repositories-does-this-apply" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>We plan to apply this license to the enterprise directories of our <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-plugin-ee-jira">Jira</a>, <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-plugin-mscalendar">Microsoft Calendar</a>, and <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-plugin-msteams-meetings">Microsoft Teams Meetings</a> plugins. We also intend to release our <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-plugin-incident-response">Incident Response</a> and <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-plugin-channel-export">Channel Export</a> plugins, currently in beta, under the Mattermost Source Available License. New, Mattermost-authored plugins will generally be released under the Mattermost Source Available License. When we update the licenses, we will release a new version and note the change in the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">README.md</span></code> file of the GitHub repository and as part of any release notes.</p>
<p>We expect to keep plugins without an enterprise component under our open source license. No licensing changes are planned to non-plugin repositories, such as <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-server">mattermost-server</a> or <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-webapp">mattermost-webapp</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="will-the-repositories-be-public">
<h3>Will the repositories be public?<a class="headerlink" href="#will-the-repositories-be-public" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Yes, existing repositories will stay public. We are now also able to make public several enterprise-only plugins under the Mattermost Source Available License previously developed in private.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="can-i-still-contribute">
<h3>Can I still contribute?<a class="headerlink" href="#can-i-still-contribute" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Yes, we continue to welcome all contributions. Mattermost may select some contributions as enterprise features and license them under the Mattermost Source Available License. We will aim to communicate such decisions as early as possible in the contribution process.</p>
<p>As with all Mattermost repositories, you will still need to sign the <a class="reference external" href="https://mattermost.org/mattermost-contributor-agreement/">Mattermost CLA</a>. We will not accept contributions without signing the Mattermost CLA.</p>

<h3>Can I compile your plugins by myself?<a class="headerlink" href="#can-i-compile-your-plugins-by-myself" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Yes. If you have a Mattermost Enterprise E20 license, you are free to compile and use a plugin under the Mattermost Source Available License. Furthermore, if you are developing against or testing with such a plugin, you are free to compile and test a plugin even without a Mattermost Enterprise E20 license. Without an Enterprise E20 license, source available plugins may have reduced functionality or refuse to start altogether. Request a <a class="reference external" href="https://mattermost.com/trial/">trial license</a> if your testing requires access to enterprise functionality.</p>
<p>Several of our customers value complete access to our source code and compile our plugins from source before deploying to their production servers. By adopting the Mattermost Source Available License, we can develop enterprise-only features in public without impacting this workflow.</p>

<div class="section" id="what-are-the-trust-benefits-of-mattermost-compared-to-third-party-saas-systems-that-let-customers-manage-their-own-encryption-keys">
<h3>What are the trust benefits of Mattermost compared to third-party SaaS systems that let customers manage their own encryption keys?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-are-the-trust-benefits-of-mattermost-compared-to-third-party-saas-systems-that-let-customers-manage-their-own-encryption-keys" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p><strong>Encryption doesn’t mean a third-party SaaS vendor can’t read your data.</strong> A third-party vendor who provides encryption keys to the database that stores a customer’s data at rest may still be able to read a customer’s data while its in transit.</p>
<p>For example, performing a search on message histories requires access to unencrypted messages in order to match the search term to words in your unencrypted message history.</p>
<p>As another example, a customer’s data encryption key is unlikely to be deployed to the mobile devices of end users; therefore, when a third-party system sends a push notification to an end user’s mobile device, the unencrypted text is available to the third party.</p>
<p>In contrast, Mattermost is hosted by the customer. Not only can data be encrypted at rest and in-transit with keys generated by the customer (which no vendors ever touch), unencrypted data for search and mobile notifications is handled by systems under your IT team’s control.</p>
<p>If it’s unclear from the vendor’s documentation whether or not your data can be read, ask them directly.</p>
<p><strong>Moreover, high trust enterprises need more than encryption - they need privacy, total data ownership, auditability, and control of their infrastructure.</strong></p>
<p><em>Privacy</em> means a third-party service cannot monitor the identity, IP address, location, or access patterns of your employees, nor their activity on your system, nor provide that information either intentionally through a court order (which you may never be informed about) or unintentionally through a data breach.</p>
<p><em>Total data ownership</em> means a third party cannot prevent you from accessing your data at any time. It means no third party can read your data, analyze it or monetize it. It means should you end your commercial relationship you maintain your records with any and all backups. It also means you can delete your data at any time and verify that no additional copies remain.</p>
<p><em>Audibility</em> means being able to fully observe, monitor, and trace the operations of your systems.</p>
<p><em>Control of infrastructure</em> means being able to operate and customize your system to the specific needs of your business, including the ability to run on public and private networks, as well as on-prem, and interoperate with critical legacy systems with full observability and transparency down to reading the source code.</p>

<h3>What are the fundamental security challenges with Massive, Multi-Tenant Applications (MMTA)?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-are-the-fundamental-security-challenges-with-massive-multi-tenant-applications-mmta" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The key risk of allowing confidential data to enter a Massively Multi-Tenant Applications (MMTA) is having the system breached, never knowing your data has been compromised, and having stolen data used to breach your other systems.</p>
<p>Marketers from MMTA vendors pay highly credentialed security professionals to offer “Death Star Logic” to gain a customer’s trust: “MMTA’s SaaS offering is the most secure system in the galaxy because it outspends its customers on security investments, therefore the MMTA is more secure than a customer’s self-hosted infrastructure.”</p>
<p>The problem with Death Star Logic is that it omits the fact that hosting confidential data from thousands of enterprise customers makes it the prime target for cyber attacks, which increases risk to customers for three key reasons:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Over time, MMTA vendors become Nation State Targets</li>
</ol>
<p>The effort behind a cyber attack is proportional to the value of breaching the system. As the value of the data held by an MMTA vendor increases, so does the scale of its cyber threats.</p>
<p>Vendors become “Nation State Targets” when the value of the breaching their system is so high it attracts the attention of the cyberwarfare branches of hostile nations. From there, even the smallest errors in system security can result in a significant breach.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="2">
<li>MMTA systems can’t protect customers from unknown vulnerabilities</li>
</ol>
<p>A single bug in an MMTA system can put all customers at risk. For example, <a class="reference external" href="https://www.wired.com/2017/03/hack-brief-slack-bug-everyones-worst-office-nightmare/">Slack reported a bug that exposed message histories and files for nearly 4 million users</a> (2017), and <a class="reference external" href="https://www.hackread.com/critical-bug-in-microsoft-left-400m-accounts-exposed/">a bug left 400 million Microsoft accounts exposed to account takeover</a> (2018).</p>
<p>For multi-tenant systems, bugs in infrastructure can present vulnerabilities as well. For example, in 2018 researchers discovered that chip-level exploits like <a class="reference external" href="https://www.wired.com/story/intel-meltdown-spectre-storm/">Meltdown and Spectre</a>, which had been around for decades, could make it possible for malicious code run by one tenant to affect the operations of another tenant that shared the same CPU.</p>
<p>Keeping MMTA systems secure depends on the ability of internal and external security researches to continually stay ahead of cyber-attackers.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="3">
<li>Customers don’t know when breaches occur</li>
</ol>
<p>When an MMTA is breached, it is most likely from an unknown bug or an unknown vulnerability. Because of this, it may not be clear that a system has been breached, and customers may not be notified. Moreover, following a breach, there’s often no way for the customer’s security team to audit the MMTA vendor and understand how their confidential data may have been accessed or stolen.</p>
<p>The end result is confidential information passing through an MMTA may be used to exploit other systems the customer operates, with no way to trace the root of the breach to mitigate it in future.</p>
<p>As an example, when <a class="reference external" href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2017/06/onelogin-breach-exposed-ability-to-decrypt-data/">OneLogin reported a security breach that allowed the attacker to decrypt encrypted data impacting 2000 customers and 70 SaaS apps</a> (2017), details were vague and there was little customers could do to analyze their risk or reduce risk in future.</p>
<p>In contrast, an open source, self-hosted collaboration solution remains within the layers of physical security and network security enterprises use to protect their most valuable assets, with full access to logging and system histories to know when, where and how an attack might have occurred.</p>
<p>Moreover, as a single-tenant solution, the strength of cyber attacks is typically limited to the breach value of just your confidential data, and not the aggregate breach value of all customer data held by an MMTA. Plus, the sum of security investments your company makes to protect systems in its private networks accrues to your collaboration system - and for banks, this could be hundreds of millions of dollars a year.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="4">
<li>MMTA systems risk cross-bleeding your data</li>
</ol>
<p>MMTA also runs the risk of bugs or misconfigurations in a vendor’s multi-tenant system bleeding your data into another customer’s space, or vice versa. Bleeds can occur via logging systems, in application logic, middleware, and data layer errors. In 2019, <a class="reference external" href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2019/03/facebook-stored-hundreds-of-millions-of-user-passwords-in-plain-text-for-years/">Facebook admitted to accidentally storing hundreds of millions of user passwords in clear text for years due to a configuration oversight</a>.</p>

<h3>Why does Mattermost disclose whether or not an account exists when a user enters an incorrect password?<a class="headerlink" href="#why-does-mattermost-disclose-whether-or-not-an-account-exists-when-a-user-enters-an-incorrect-password" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Mattermost’s core design principle is to be <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.mattermost.com/developer/fx-guidelines.html#fast-obvious-forgiving">“fast, obvious, forgiving”</a> and, telling users that they made a mistake in entering their password, is in service of our principle of prioritizing user interests.</p>
<p>When using username-password authentication, especially with AD/LDAP, there’s the possibility of usernames being email addresses, Mattermost username, AD/LDAP username, AD/LDAP ID, or other AD/LDAP attributes and our design principle intends to help end users understand whether their login error came from having the wrong password or the wrong email/username.</p>
<p>We believe this design increases productivity, speeds up user adoption, and reduces help desk tickets and support costs - and that these benefits outweigh the trade-offs.</p>
<p>The trade-off with this design is that if physical security is not in effect, and network security is not in effect (i.e., no VPN, or a malicious user within the private network), and username-password authentication is used, an attacker may be able to enumerate email addresses or usernames by sending HTTP requests to the system, up to the maximum number of requests per second defined in Mattermost’s <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.mattermost.com/administration/config-settings.html#rate-limiting">API rate limiting settings</a>.</p>
<p>For organizations who choose to deploy in such a configuration, please consider the following mitigations:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Instead of username-password, use a Single Sign-On (SSO) provider in Mattermost Enterprise Edition like OneLogin, Okta, or ADFS, or use the open source GitLab SSO option available with Mattermost Team Edition.</li>
<li>Per the recommended install instructions, use a VPN client to apply network security to your deployment.</li>
<li>Enable monitoring and alerting from your proxy server to detect and isolate malicious behavior reaching your deployment.</li>
</ol>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Above all, make sure to subscribe to the <a class="reference external" href="https://mattermost.com/security-updates/#sign-up">Mattermost Security Bulletin</a> and apply security patches as recommended.</p>

<h3>How can I create an open source derivative work of Mattermost?<a class="headerlink" href="#how-can-i-create-an-open-source-derivative-work-of-mattermost" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>If you’re looking to customize the look and feel of Mattermost, see <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/mattermost/docs/issues/1006">documentation on customization</a>. For advanced customization, the user experience of the system is available in different repositories for web, mobile apps, and desktop apps and custom experiences can be developed and integrated with either Mattermost Team Edition or Mattermost Enterprise Edition via the system APIs and drivers.</p>
<p>If, instead of using Mattermost Team Edition or Mattermost Enterprise Edition, you choose to compile your own version of the system using the open source code from <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">/mattermost-server</span></code>, there are a number of factors to consider:</p>
<div class="section" id="security">
<h4>Security<a class="headerlink" href="#security" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<ul class="simple">
<li>If you run a fork of the Mattermost server we highly recommend you only deploy the system securely behind a firewall and to pay close attention to <a class="reference external" href="https://mattermost.com/security-updates/">Mattermost security updates</a>. Mattermost Team Edition and Mattermost Enterprise Edition release security update patches when reports of new attacks are received and verified. Mattermost waits until 14 days after a security patch is released before publicly detailing its nature, so that users and customers can upgrade before the security vulnerability is widely known. A malicous user can potentially make use of Mattermost security disclosures to exploit a fork of Mattermost if the security upgrade is not promptly incorporated into the forked version.</li>

<h3>Can I create a derivative work of the Mattermost /mattermost-server repository that is not open source?<a class="headerlink" href="#can-i-create-a-derivative-work-of-the-mattermost-mattermost-server-repository-that-is-not-open-source" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The Mattermost open source project was created by <a class="reference external" href="https://mattermost.org/why-we-made-mattermost-an-open-source-slack-alternative/">a group of developers who had their data paywalled by a proprietary online messaging service</a> and felt it was unfair.</p>
<p>Because of this, the Mattermost /mattermost-server repository uses an open source license that requires derivative works to use the same open source license. This prevents the creation of derivative works that are not open source, and the situation where end users would not have access to the source code of the systems they use, and hence be at risk of “lock in”.</p>
<p>For companies purchasing Enterprise Edition subscriptions for use by internal staff, who need to modify /mattermost-server, and who also have legal departments that won’t allow their staff to work under an open source software license, a special “Advanced Licensing Option” can be purchased to modify /mattermost-server for internal use under a commercial software license. This option is not available for companies that would offer a modified, non-open source version of Mattermost to external parties.</p>

<p>No.</p>
<p>If there is a case where the reseller agreement is under review and an order is urgently needed by a customer, Mattermost may, with internal approvals, accept a reseller purchase order with the following language:</p>
