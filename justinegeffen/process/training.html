<p>When proposing meetings use famous cities as references for time (e.g. 9am Toronto time), since itâs clear and <a class="reference external" href="https://www.google.com/search?ei=8w9nXdn0HMH4-wTH1JrgCA&amp;q=time+in+toronto&amp;oq=time+in+toronto">easy to web search</a>. Avoid using âUTCâ, as it has been shown to cause confusion.</p>
<p>When selecting a timezone city, use the most well-known city in a country where at least one team member is located. Exception: When possible, use a city where we have an official mailing address, e.g. In Western Americas use Palo Alto, instead of San Francisco. In Eastern Americas use Toronto, instead of New York.</p>

<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#contents">Scheduling Recurring Group Meetings</a><a class="headerlink" href="#scheduling-recurring-group-meetings" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h3>
<p>Recurring meetings with more than two people should have one or more regular slots on the calendar reserved so that meetings can be coordinated in a straight-forward way.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Meetings with internal colleagues should be coordinated by checking everyoneâs availability in G Suite Calendar.</li>
<li>Meetings with external colleagues should be coordinated manually with one internal person coordinating everyoneâs G Suite Calendars.</li>
</ol>
<p>For efficiency, when Mattermost works with advisors and consultants who engage with two or more internal team members, we aim to schedule meetings in regular slots (or a collection of regular slots) 2-4 weeks apart.</p>

<p>Inspired by Corey Hulenâs blog article of <a class="reference external" href="http://hulen.com/video-conf-peevs/">6 Annoying Things People Do During Video Conferencing</a>.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Avoid responding to messages in chat while on a meeting:</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>It can be distracting when someone tries to covertly respond to a message. First, other people on call may hear your keyboard and notice youâre looking somewhere else. Second, if they are in the same channel as you, they can see the message <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[User]</span> <span class="pre">is</span> <span class="pre">typing...</span></code> in Mattermost.</li>
<li><strong>Tip:</strong> If you feel the need to respond immediately and are easily distracted, set yourself to âDo Not Disturbâ mode while in meetings.</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="2">
<li>Avoid answering calls or checking text messages on your cell phone:</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li><strong>Tip:</strong> Put your phone on silent and place it out of armâs reach, face down, so you donât feel compelled to act.</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="3">
<li>Display your video on a monitor with your camera:</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>If you have your video display on a second monitor, it may cause you to look away from the camera, not looking at the camera when talking. It almost feels like youâre talking to someone else in the room behind your computer monitor.</li>
<li><strong>Tip:</strong> Either move your camera, or move your video window so they are somewhat inline. Also remember to look towards the camera.</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="4">
<li>Mute audio in large video conferences when not speaking:</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>When not muted, others can hear random noises, like a fan running or a loud click-clack keyboard, which can be distracting.</li>
<li><strong>Tip:</strong> Set your Zoom meetings to be on mute by default via Zoom settings.</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="5">
<li>Avoid fidgeting uncontrollably or spinning in your office chair:</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li><strong>Tip:</strong> If youâre in a group meeting and not doing much talking, feel free to stop your video.</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="6">
<li>Avoid connecting with your computer but also dialing in via cell phone:</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>If you connect with your computer and dial in, there are two of you in the meeting and the voice/video are not synced when you talk. In large groups, there will be a random cell phone number that no one will know who they are.</li>
<li><strong>Tip:</strong> If you have a bad internet connection and have to dial in, exit the Zoom meeting on your computer.</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="7">
<li>When presenting, increase window zoom size or set Powerpoint slides to presenter mode:</li>

<p><strong>Why donât new people introduce themselves?</strong></p>
<p>Not everyone is comfortable with speaking in front of 60+ people. Not everyone speaks clear English. We donât want the first company-wide meeting to be anxious for new team members, hence by default managers intro them. New hires can opt-in to introducing themselves.</p>

Otherwise the ticket is assigned to a team with a âTriageâ Fix Version and is later prioritized and assigned to the appropriate people within that team.</li>

<p>Designing world-class software means bringing people together across disciplines and cultures. We want to create a limited amount of shared terminology to help us work better together, while being careful not to make it difficult for newcomers to follow our conversation.</p>
<p>Perhaps in future weâll have a bot that helps teach newcomers about the terminology in-context. Until then we have this guide.</p>

<p>For example, â0/5â and â5/5â help convey the level of conviction behind an opinion. Also, a precise classification of tickets as âBugâ or âImprovementâ is critical since it affects scheduling and decision making, and so forth.</p>

Roles arenât necessarily job titles, for small projects, a developer might take on a product manager role, or vice versa.

<p>When becoming a core committer to the Mattermost project we create a âMattermost Avatarâ for you as a fun way to recognize your new level of contribution.</p>
<p>Mattermost avatars are caricatures of core committers in the costume of a popular culture character (e.g. Spiderman, Wonder Woman, Luke Skywalker, etc.) created for personal use, and which may be potentially used in team rosters, demonstration sites, âgroup photosâ where avatar images from the team are collected in one image of all the characters together, and other public uses.</p>
<p>To have a Mattermost avatar created, youâll be invited to create a Mattermost avatar via email:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Please use the email subject â[YOUR_FULL_NAME] as [CHARACTER_NAME]â, for example âCorey Hulen as Han Soloâ.</li>
<li>Attach a clear image at least 600 pixels high and 600 pixels wide showing your characterâs full body in a standing pose.</li>
<li>Send a clear photo of your face at least 600 pixels high and 600 pixels wide facing the same direction as your character image.</li>
</ol>
<p>Notes:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Character should be human-sized (no giant characters).</li>
<li>Characterâs appearance should be family-friendly. For example, no gory or provocative costumes.</li>
</ol>
<p>You should receive your digital Mattermost avatars by email in 6-8 weeks.</p>
<p>In special cases, a Mattermost avatar may be created for someone from the Mattermost community who has made an extraordinary contribution to the open source project.</p>
<ul class="simple">

<p>Staff must use their full name for their username, as in <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">first.last</span></code>, on the community server. Staff are also encouraged to link to their GitHub account using the command <cite>/github connect</cite> so that your GitHub handle will appear on your profile pop-over card.  All Mattermost  staff should be issued a OneLogin account with a username of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">first.last</span></code>.  If issued a OneLogin account, you should switch your sign-in method from email/password to OneLogin via <strong>Account Settings &gt; Security &gt; Sign-in Method</strong> page.

If you find yourself creating a private channel on this team you should pause and ask yourself if it really needs to be private.

Since this team only includes people with mattermost.com email address, you should prefer creating public channels.  Also, if you find yourself creating a channel here, you should ask yourself if it would be better served to have it in the Contributors team.  Mattermost staff will be synced to the appropriate channels based on their LDAP group sync settings.</p>

You should prefer public channels when you want partner-to-partner interactions and private channels when you want staff-to-partner interactions.  Remember that any partner added to the team will be able to join any public channel.</p>
