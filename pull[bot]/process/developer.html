<h1>Staff Developers<a class="headerlink" href="#staff-developers" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>As a core committer at Mattermost, you are responsible for one of the world’s largest and most popular open source projects. Your work impacts thousands of organizations who depend on Mattermost for daily operations, from high tech (Intel, Samsung, Micron), to healthcare (Medtronic, Epic, Bristol-Myers Squibb), to public sector (U.S. Department of Defense, U.S. Department of Energy), to education (University of California, National University of Singapore), and consumer brands (Urban Outfitters, Wargaming.net).</p>
<p>Working in open source means your work is publicly visible. Your code will receive both credit and critique from the community and with the right mindset and support that can lead to you making the best engineering decisions of your career.</p>
<p>Core committers include volunteer developers from the community, staff by organizations deploying and investing in Mattermost, as well as staff paid by Mattermost, Inc.</p>
<p>This document summarizes the responsibilities and requirements of core committers employed by Mattermost, Inc., skill level requirements, and hiring process. Staff developers work closely with Mattermost product management to envision, design, plan, develop, coordinate, review, and merge improvements per our <a class="reference external" href="../developer/contribution-guide.html">contribution guidelines</a> on a regular basis.</p>
<p>Ideally, developers are “full stack”, and comfortable moving across backend and frontend projects. As part of our <a class="reference external" href="training.html#learn-master-teach">learn, master, teach</a> mindset, our environment has people consistently cross-training, becoming experts, and passing on knowledge to new team members rotating into new areas of responsibility. That said, we also welcome engineers who prefer to specialize in backend and frontend, since there’s ample projects to find in both areas.</p>
<div class="section" id="responsibilities">

</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="audition">
<h2>Audition<a class="headerlink" href="#audition" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>For the benefit of candidates and the company, Mattermost offers real-world “try out” projects with Mattermost team members to simulate what it would be like to work at the company prior to hiring. The practice of auditions in open source companies was pioneered by Automattic (creators of WordPress) and detailed by <a class="reference external" href="https://hbr.org/2014/04/the-ceo-of-automattic-on-holding-auditions-to-build-a-strong-team">Harvard Business Review in 2014</a>. This practice has been a vital part of Mattermost culture.</p>
<p>Candidates who show strong potential for technical and cultural fit are invited to work on tasks that are part of their desired position, complete a project designed by their potential manager, or select from open <a class="reference external" href="https://mattermost.com/pl/help-wanted">Help Wanted tickets</a> to be completed per the <a class="reference external" href="https://developers.mattermost.com/contribute/getting-started/">Mattermost contribution guidelines</a>. Your work will become a permanent part of the open source project that you can reference for the rest of your career. You’re also eligible to receive a <a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23mattermug&amp;src=typd">Mattermost Mug</a> in appreciation of your first contribution. Here’s an example of <a class="reference external" href="https://www.movetoiceland.com/mattermost-recipe-1-preview-videos/#.Wz2kb9hKjUK">a successful project completed during a tryout</a>.</p>
<p>While you’re working with us, you can join the Mattermost community site <a class="reference external" href="https://community.mattermost.com/core/">here</a>.</p>
<p>Once signed-in, the following channels are recommended for observing how the core committers work with the community to ship new releases:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://community.mattermost.com/core/channels/developers">Developers</a></li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://community.mattermost.com/core/channels/bugs">Bugs</a></li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://community.mattermost.com/core/channels/release-checklist">Release Checklist</a></li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://community.mattermost.com/core/channels/release-discussion">Release Discussion</a></li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://community.mattermost.com/core/channels/peer-to-peer-help">Peer-to-Peer Help</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Observing these public channels as you work will give you a good sense of what it is like to work at Mattermost in a full time capacity to ensure joining the company aligns to your interests and desired career direction.</p>
<p>During the tryout, candidates will submit invoices for up to 40 hours of work (example <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Lx1f3nX64pJTJOttW_QoJwrfRekh0ISjmIwZ7_ePG1g/edit#gid=1">here</a>). All candidates will be paid $25/hour, regardless of position. Mattermost uses a <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1G4wFLq_wHHEDJ-hrv5Kmu022mFJgh3rJ4-glM0W6riI/edit?usp=sharing">standard consulting agreement template</a> and provides instructions for invoicing at the start of the tryout. Note that the hourly rate is not necessarily representative of the final offer that would be extended to a successful candidate.</p>

<div class="section" id="do-you-have-internships">
<h3>Do you have internships?<a class="headerlink" href="#do-you-have-internships" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>While we no longer offer internships for developers, if you get a couple of <a class="reference external" href="https://mattermost.com/pl/help-wanted">Help Wanted</a> pull requests accepted, we’ll interview you for one. This will be a remote internship without supervision; you’ll only get feedback on your merge requests. If you want to work on open source and qualify, <a class="reference external" href="https://jobs.lever.co/mattermost/">please submit an application</a>. In the cover letter field, please note that you want an internship and link to the accepted pull requests. The pull requests should be of significant value and difficulty, which is at the discretion of the hiring manager. For example, fixing 10 typos isn’t as valuable as shipping 2 new features.</p>
